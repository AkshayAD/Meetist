## **Current Sprint: Infrastructure & Testing**

### **Active Tasks This Week:**
1. **GitHub Actions Fix** - Update deprecated v3 artifacts to v4
2. **Testing Framework** - Set up Jest + React Native Testing Library  
3. **Service Tests** - Create tests for all 15 services
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Implement automated testing in workflow

### **Completed This Session:**
- ‚úÖ Development roadmap created
- ‚úÖ Task tracking system established
- ‚úÖ Architecture documentation updated

## **Critical Gaps Identified:**

### üö® **High Priority Issues:**
1. **No Test Coverage** - 0% coverage currently (Target: 80%)
2. **Broken CI/CD** - GitHub Actions using deprecated artifacts
3. **Unused Dependencies** - react-native-voice installed but not integrated
4. **Simulated Features** - Whisper transcription not actually implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Priority Issues:**
1. **No Error Monitoring** - No crash reporting or analytics
2. **Security Gaps** - No biometric auth, plain text API storage
3. **Performance Unknowns** - No benchmarking or monitoring
4. **Missing E2E Tests** - Can't validate complete user flows

### üìù **Low Priority Issues:**
1. **Documentation Gaps** - Missing API docs and component stories
2. **Accessibility** - Not tested for screen readers or accessibility
3. **Internationalization** - English only currently

## **Quality Standards:**

### **Testing Requirements:**
- Services: 100% test coverage (15 services)
- Components: 80% minimum coverage  
- Screens: 70% minimum coverage
- Overall: 80% minimum coverage
- E2E: Critical user flows covered

### **Performance Targets:**
- Cold start: <3 seconds
- Transcription: <1 minute per 5 minutes audio
- Memory usage: <500MB peak during transcription
- APK size: <100MB including models
- Battery drain: <5% per hour of recording

### **Security Standards:**
- API keys encrypted in storage
- Biometric authentication for sensitive features
- No sensitive data in logs
- Certificate pinning for API calls
- OWASP Mobile Security compliance

## **Success Metrics Tracking:**

### **Technical KPIs:**
- [ ] Test Coverage: 0% ‚Üí 80% target
- [ ] Build Success Rate: Unknown ‚Üí 100% target  
- [ ] Performance Benchmarks: Not established ‚Üí All green
- [ ] Security Scan: Not run ‚Üí Pass OWASP checklist
- [ ] Crash-Free Rate: Unknown ‚Üí 99.5% target

### **User Experience KPIs:**
- [x] Transcription Accuracy: 90-95% (Gemini)
- [x] Processing Speed: 5-10 sec/min audio  
- [ ] App Responsiveness: Not measured ‚Üí <100ms UI response
- [ ] User Satisfaction: Not measured ‚Üí 4.5+ stars target

## **Timeline Estimates:**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure (3 hours)**
- Fix GitHub Actions: 30 minutes
- Setup Jest framework: 1 hour
- Create initial service tests: 1.5 hours

### **Phase 2: Core Completion (5 hours)** 
- Device speech integration: 2 hours
- Complete test coverage: 3 hours

### **Phase 3: Professional Features (8 hours)**
- PDF export: 2 hours
- Email/Calendar integration: 2 hours  
- Security enhancements: 2 hours
- Performance optimization: 2 hours

### **Phase 4: Production Polish (8 hours)**
- E2E testing suite: 4 hours
- Monitoring integration: 2 hours
- Documentation/Deployment: 2 hours

**Total Estimated Time: 24 hours**

## **Risk Assessment:**

### **High Risk:**
- Native Whisper module complexity (requires C++ expertise)
- E2E testing setup complexity with React Native
- Performance issues on low-end devices (3GB RAM)

### **Medium Risk:**  
- Third-party API rate limits and costs
- Device compatibility across Android versions
- App store approval process

### **Low Risk:**
- Basic feature implementations (PDF, email)
- Documentation and code organization
- Testing framework setup

## **Next Session Goals:**
1. Fix GitHub Actions workflow completely
2. Set up Jest testing with first passing test
3. Create tests for RealTranscriptionService  
4. Implement device speech recognition
5. Update this roadmap with progress
