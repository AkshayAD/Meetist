# Current Task: Setup Jest Testing Framework

## **Task Priority: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**

### **Objective**
Establish comprehensive testing framework with Jest and React Native Testing Library to enable automated testing for the Meetist application.

### **Problem Statement**
The application currently has **0% test coverage** with no testing framework configured. This is a critical gap for professional-grade software development and prevents automated quality assurance.

### **Requirements**
1. **Install Testing Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-native
   npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer babel-jest
   ```

2. **Configure Jest:**
   - Create `jest.config.js` with React Native preset
   - Set up test environment and module mapping
   - Configure coverage reporting
   - Set up test scripts in `package.json`

3. **Create Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Set up test utilities and helpers
   - Create mock files for React Native modules
   - Establish testing patterns and standards
   - Create first service test as example

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Testing dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] Jest configuration file created and working
- [ ] Package.json test scripts configured
- [ ] Test environment properly set up for React Native
- [ ] Coverage reporting configured (target: 80%)
- [ ] First test file created and passing
- [ ] Test command runs without errors: `npm test`
- [ ] Coverage command works: `npm run test:coverage`

### **Technical Implementation Steps**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd meetist
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-native react-test-renderer babel-jest
   ```

2. **Create Jest Configuration (jest.config.js):**
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'react-native',
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-native/extend-expect'],
     testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/', '<rootDir>/android/', '<rootDir>/ios/'],
     collectCoverage: true,
     collectCoverageFrom: [
       'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
       '!src/**/*.d.ts',
       '!src/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
     ],
     coverageThreshold: {
       global: {
         branches: 80,
         functions: 80,
         lines: 80,
         statements: 80
       }
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Update Package.json Scripts:**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test": "jest",
       "test:watch": "jest --watch",
       "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
       "test:unit": "jest --testPathPattern=unit"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Create First Test:**
   - Test `RealTranscriptionService` basic functionality
   - Ensure test passes and coverage is calculated
   - Establish testing patterns for other developers

### **Files to Create/Modify**
- `meetist/jest.config.js` (new)
- `meetist/package.json` (update scripts)
- `meetist/src/__tests__/RealTranscriptionService.test.ts` (new)
- `meetist/__mocks__/` directory (new)

### **Expected Outcome**
- âœ… Jest framework fully configured and working
- âœ… Test commands functional (`npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`)
- âœ… Coverage reporting active with 80% threshold
- âœ… First service test created and passing
- âœ… Foundation for comprehensive test suite
- âœ… CI/CD integration ready (tests run before build)

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Run `npm test` - should execute without errors
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` - should generate coverage report
- [ ] Verify coverage threshold enforcement
- [ ] Check test file structure and patterns
- [ ] Validate mocking setup works correctly

### **Time Estimate: 1 hour**

### **Dependencies**
- GitHub Actions workflow (completed)
- Node.js and npm working correctly

### **Risks**
- **Low Risk:** React Native testing setup complexity  
- **Medium Risk:** Mock configuration for Expo modules
- **Low Risk:** Coverage threshold too strict initially

### **Success Validation**
1. `npm test` runs successfully with at least 1 passing test
2. Coverage report generates with clear metrics  
3. Test output is readable and informative
4. CI/CD pipeline can run tests (verified in next task)
5. Code coverage meets minimum 80% threshold for tested files

### **Integration with CI/CD**
Once Jest is configured, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
- Run `npm test` before building APK
- Fail builds if tests fail  
- Generate coverage reports in artifacts
- Block merges if coverage drops below threshold

## **Next Task After Completion:**
Create Unit Tests for RealTranscriptionService - See DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md Phase 1

**Task Started:** Current Session (after GitHub Actions completion)  
**Estimated Completion:** Within 1 hour  
**Assigned Priority:** ðŸš¨ Critical Infrastructure  
**Previous Task:** âœ… GitHub Actions Workflow Fix (COMPLETED)
