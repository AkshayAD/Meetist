# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

Meetist is a React Native/Expo mobile meeting recorder and transcriber app focused on privacy and local processing. The app supports real-time transcription using multiple AI models (Gemini, Whisper, device speech recognition) and generates AI-powered meeting summaries.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Installation
```bash
cd meetist
npm install
```

### Running the App
```bash
# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# Start with specific platform
npx expo start --android
npx expo start --ios

# Start with tunnel (for remote device testing)
npx expo start --tunnel
```

### Building APK
```bash
# Using EAS Build (cloud)
eas build -p android --profile preview

# Local build
eas build -p android --profile preview --local

# Using build script
./build-apk.sh
```

### Testing Real Transcription
To test real transcription functionality, you need a Gemini API key:
1. Get key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Configure in Settings â†’ Transcription Models
3. Default model: Gemini 2.5 Flash (free tier available)

## Architecture

### Service Layer Architecture
The app uses a modular service architecture with 15 specialized services:

- **RealTranscriptionService**: Orchestrates transcription across multiple models (Gemini, Whisper Cloud, Device Speech)
- **MeetingSummaryService**: Generates structured AI summaries with action items, timeline, and insights
- **MultiModelTranscriptionService**: Manages 12+ transcription providers including Groq, Together AI, AssemblyAI
- **WhisperModelService**: Handles Whisper model downloads and management (8 models: tiny to medium)
- **GeminiService**: Interfaces with Gemini API for AI enhancements
- **AudioService**: Manages recording and playback with expo-av

### State Management
Redux Toolkit with three main slices:
- `meetingsSlice`: Meeting CRUD operations and search
- `recordingSlice`: Recording state and audio management
- `settingsSlice`: App configuration and preferences

### Navigation Structure
- Bottom tabs: Home, Meetings, Settings
- Stack navigation for detail screens
- Main recording flow: HomeScreen â†’ RecordingScreenReal â†’ Meeting saved to Redux

### Data Storage Strategy
- **SQLite** (expo-sqlite): Meeting metadata and transcripts
- **MMKV** (react-native-mmkv): App settings and preferences
- **AsyncStorage**: API keys (encrypted)
- **FileSystem**: Audio files and Whisper models

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Whisper Integration Status
The app architecture for Whisper is complete but actual transcription is **simulated**:
- Models download correctly from Hugging Face
- UI shows proper transcription flow
- WhisperTranscriptionService returns placeholder text
- Full implementation requires native module (whisper.cpp binding)

### Real vs Simulated Services
- **Working**: Gemini transcription, cloud APIs, meeting management
- **Simulated**: Local Whisper processing (WhisperTranscriptionService)
- **Fallback**: Use RealTranscriptionService with Gemini for actual transcription

### API Key Management
API keys are shared between services:
- Gemini key works for all Gemini models
- Stored in AsyncStorage under 'transcription_api_keys'
- MeetingSummaryService uses same key as RealTranscriptionService

### Recording Configuration
- Format: WAV, 16kHz mono (optimized for Whisper)
- Metering enabled for waveform visualization
- Background recording supported
- Maximum duration: 3 hours

## Key Files to Understand

### Core Screens
- `RecordingScreenReal.tsx`: Main recording interface with file import
- `MeetingDetailScreenEnhanced.tsx`: Tabbed view with transcript and AI summary
- `TranscriptionSettingsScreen.tsx`: API key configuration and model selection

### Essential Services
- `RealTranscriptionService.ts`: Production transcription implementation
- `MeetingSummaryService.ts`: AI summary generation with caching
- `WhisperModelService.ts`: Model download and management (currently simulated processing)

### Components
- `AudioWaveform.tsx`: Real-time audio visualization
- `MeetingSummaryTab.tsx`: Structured summary display with collapsible sections

## Performance Constraints
- Target devices: 3-4GB RAM Android phones
- Max memory usage: 500MB during transcription
- Model sizes: Whisper tiny (39MB) to medium (1.5GB)
- Chunk-based processing for memory efficiency

## Build Configuration
- Bundle ID: com.meetist.app
- Min Android SDK: 24 (Android 7.0)
- EAS Build configured for preview and production
- GitHub Actions workflow exists but needs artifact action update

## Testing Approach
When testing transcription:
1. Use RecordingScreenReal (not older variants)
2. Configure Gemini API key first
3. Test with short audio (< 1 min) initially
4. Import audio files via document picker for consistency

## Testing Commands

### Setup Testing (when implemented)
```bash
cd meetist
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-native
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only  
npm run test:integration # Integration tests
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode for development
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Cold start time**: <3 seconds (target)
- **Transcription speed**: <1 minute per 5 minutes audio
- **Memory usage**: <500MB peak during transcription
- **APK size**: <100MB including assets
- **Battery usage**: <5% per hour of recording

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: 80% minimum overall, 100% for services
- **Build Success**: 100% CI/CD success rate required
- **Performance**: All benchmarks must pass
- **Security**: OWASP Mobile Security checklist compliance
- **Accessibility**: React Native accessibility guidelines

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Standard development cycle
npm start                 # Start development server
npm run lint             # Run ESLint (when configured)
npm run type-check       # TypeScript validation
npm test                 # Run test suite
npm run build-apk        # Local APK build using EAS
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Status
- **GitHub Actions**: âœ… Fixed - uses v4 actions
- **Automated Testing**: ðŸ”„ Planned - will run tests before build
- **APK Artifacts**: âœ… Working - 30-day retention
- **Release Automation**: âœ… Working - auto-release on main branch
- **Build Caching**: âœ… Implemented - faster subsequent builds

### Recursive Development System
This repository uses automated recursive development:
- **DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md**: Master progress tracking
- **CURRENT_TASK.md**: Active task details
- **RECURSIVE_PROMPT.md**: Template for continued development
- **Quality Gates**: Every task must pass tests before completion

### Current Priority Tasks
1. Set up Jest testing framework (Phase 1)
2. Create comprehensive service tests  
3. Integrate device speech recognition
4. Implement native Whisper module
5. Add professional features (PDF export, security)

### Development Guidelines
- Every feature requires tests with 80% coverage minimum
- No performance regressions allowed
- Mobile-first responsive design maintained
- Error handling for offline/poor network conditions
- Memory leak prevention and monitoring
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Current Branch Context
